# Hate-Speech-detection
This project is a Hate Speech Detection System that classifies text into three categories:
1. Hate Speech â€“ Explicit hate towards individuals or groups
2. Offensive Language â€“ Contains inappropriate or rude words but not hate speech
3. Neither â€“ Neutral or safe content

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:
Python
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, SVM, or any model used)
Google Colab
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK

 Dataset
Used a publicly available dataset containing labeled hate speech, offensive language, and neutral text.

Features
1.Text preprocessing (stopword removal, tokenization, stemming, etc.)
2.Multi-class classification using ML models
3.Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
4.Real-time text classification
